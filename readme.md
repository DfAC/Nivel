This is the code for processing Leica Nivel 220 reading, part of University of Nottingham H24VEP MSc course (Project 3 Bridge monitoring). For more details check my [TeachingSlides](https://github.com/DfAC/TeachingSlides/tree/master/H24VEP_Bridge).

# Quick start

If you just want to process (parse) Nivel files, download *ParseSnifferData.exe* put it into a folder with *.log* files and run. Output files are *log_file_name.out*

# More information

More in-depth information can be found on the [Wiki pages of this project](../../wiki).

Note, that you can clone wiki pages as well using `git clone https://github.com/DfAC/Nivel.wiki.git`.


# Data analysis

This repo includes a sample code demonstrating introductory data analysis of Nivel data. This includes

* A [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) script (*NivelAnalysis.Rmd*) is provided as a sample.
* *exploreTime.bat* and *exploreTime.plt* is an example of visual analysis using GNUplot.


For more information check [Wiki pages of this project](../../wiki) and * *./Docs* containing all Leica Geosystem manuals for Nivel.
